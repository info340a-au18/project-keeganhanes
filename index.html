        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
        <p>
            “RYD” is a start up in Vancouver WA that acts like an Uber for employees at various 
        businesses around downtown. The service is free due to an agreement with the city to 
        fully fund it. RYD’s vision is to not only to help transport employees to and from work but 
        to also take the general public where they need to go, free of charge. This idea came 
        about after several companies made complaints about how limited parking was for their 
        employees.

        The U-District is a busy and populated area of Seattle with very limited parking. 
        More than half of UW’s students live off campus and a decent amount of those students 
        have cars. When the place you usually park is completely full or you’re parking somewhere 
        you have never been before it can be frustrating to find a spot and even cause you to be 
        late to where you’re going. If there was an easy and convenient way to know where the 
        best place to park is and how much it’s going to cost, you would save a lot of time and 
        money by preventing yourself from getting a ticket. Although incorporating a service 
        similar to RYD in Seattle would be much more difficult considering the cities size, 
        there are still ways to help the situation. An application that visually shows you where
        the best places to park around the U-district are would be extremely helpful. It could 
        show you the spots that are most likely going to be full based on the time and day, as 
        well as if you are going to need to pay or not. Although there are applications and 
        websites that have similar functionality this application would be geared towards the 
        students at UW. We could draw inspirations from other companies while still making it 
        unique and our own.

        <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                U-park
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This applications purpose would be to help the user find the best available 
                        parking space in the U-district relative to their location, date and time. 
                        There would be benefits to having both a website and an application so that 
                        if the user needed to find parking last minute they could do so on their phone. 
                        The app could potentially even offer discounts for parking garages or parking spots 
                        that are only available to the users of the app.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                “Help me park”
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This applications purpose would be to get you in contact with someone who 
                        will help you park your car. Imagine you are late to an important event and 
                        when you get there you cannot find parking. Someone near you can then 
                        be paid to park your car in the nearest available parking space and then update 
                        you on where it is via the application.
